"Let's Fly Bird" is a lightweight, responsive web project that uses pure HTML and CSS to animate a bird flying across the screen — but only on larger screens. On smaller screens, the bird stays grounded with a playful message. It’s a fun demonstration of media queries, CSS variables, and visual feedback in responsive design.
