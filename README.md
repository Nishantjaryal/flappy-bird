Flappy Bird is a classic arcade-style game where the player controls a bird trying to fly between sets of pipes without hitting them. Built with smooth animations and responsive controls, the game challenges players with progressively difficult obstacles, testing timing and precision. Simple mechanics, addictive gameplay

"Let's Fly Bird" is a lightweight, responsive web project that uses pure HTML and CSS to animate a bird flying across the screen — but only on larger screens. On smaller screens, the bird stays grounded with a playful message. It’s a fun demonstration of media queries, CSS variables, and visual feedback in responsive design.
